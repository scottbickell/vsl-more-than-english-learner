Learn the What, Why, and How of literacy instruction

Dear %%first_name%%,

Teaching reading is hard work. Many new teachers need additional support understanding the pedagogy of literacy instruction.

LETRS® (Language Essentials for Teachers of Reading and Spelling) gives new teachers the background and depth of knowledge to teach language and literacy skills to every student.

With new LETRS, educators receive:
•	Updated information about the brain and learning to read
•	Expert authorship by Dr. Louisa Moats
•	Explicit assignments to practice and apply what they are learning
•	Online and flexible implementation options

Give your new teachers the strong foundational literacy skills necessary to help every student learn to read.
